- currently, all functions of the "awstatic" JavaScript "module" are
  publicy available. This is because tests need access to them.
  However, only 'init_ui()' should be made public: how could I make
  the other functions private and still test them?

- feature: add "browsers/OS" report

- feature: add "all-time" key for all reports

- test with recent versions of Firefox and Chrome
